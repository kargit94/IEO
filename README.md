•	The UK has enacted a legally binding target to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. To meet this target, carbon emissions resulting from heating homes must be reduced. Heat is lost less easily through walls, floors, and roofs when a building is well insulated, making it easier to maintain a comfortable temperature.
•	ECO Green deal is one of the government's programs-They replaced the previous energy efficiency schemes: the carbon emissions reduction target, community energy-saving program, and warm front. Their aim is to improve the efficiency of the country’s homes by encouraging the uptake of energy efficiency measures through grants, loans, and subsidies
